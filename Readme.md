================

In this competition, I used seven methods to approach the prediction.

1.  1D CNN
2.  2D CNN trained on one-hot encoder
3.  LSTM/Recurrent neural networks
4.  Variational auto encoder (VAE) fed into supervised learning
    algorithm
5.  Feed forward neural network
6.  Natural language processing(NLP) embeddings of k-mers
